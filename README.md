SCARA Kinematics
================

[Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)-based visualisation of the forward/inverse
kinematics of a parallel-arm SCARA similar to the RepRap Wally. In this version
I drove the shoulders as opposed to the elbows which is what I ended up going
with in [my ill-fated SCARA bot](https://github.com/lerouxb/scarabot).
